# Mastertour MCP - Project Status

> Last Updated: January 3, 2026

## Current Phase: Implementation

### Status: 🟢 Ready for OAuth Module

Timezone spike complete. API connectivity verified. Ready to implement OAuth module.

---

## Scope Definition

### MVP Scope (Reduced)
**Single Tool Focus:** `get_today_schedule`

We are prioritizing end-to-end functionality over breadth. The MVP will deliver ONE fully working tool that demonstrates:
- OAuth 1.0 authentication with Master Tour API
- API request/response handling
- MCP server integration
- Complete test coverage (unit + integration)
- Production-ready error handling

### Out of Scope (Deferred)
- All other tools (get_tour_info, get_hotel_info, find_contact, get_guest_list)
- Write operations
- Resources and Prompts
- Multi-tour support

These will be addressed in subsequent phases after MVP is proven.

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Build from scratch | No existing MCP server; existing wrappers unmaintained | Jan 3, 2026 |
| TypeScript + MCP SDK | Official SDK, type safety | Jan 3, 2026 |
| OAuth 1.0a package | Standard solution for Master Tour auth | Jan 3, 2026 |
| Single-tool MVP | Prove end-to-end before expanding | Jan 3, 2026 |
| TDD approach | Mandated by project guidelines | Jan 3, 2026 |
| Both mock + integration tests | Comprehensive coverage | Jan 3, 2026 |
| axios for HTTP | Consistent interceptors, typed responses | Jan 3, 2026 |
| date-fns for dates | Tree-shakeable, good TS support | Jan 3, 2026 |
| Vitest for testing | Fast, native ESM, modern | Jan 3, 2026 |
| tsx for dev runner | Fast TS execution without build | Jan 3, 2026 |
| Use paulStartTime for display | API provides local time directly; no conversion needed | Jan 3, 2026 |
| Base URL: /portal/api/v5/ | Discovered via spike; docs had wrong URL | Jan 3, 2026 |

---

## Blockers & Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| OAuth 1.0 complexity | Use proven oauth-1.0a package | Monitoring |
| API documentation gaps | Have real account for testing | ✅ Resolved |
| Rate limiting unknown | Build in retry logic | Planning |
| Timezone semantics unknown | Spike completed - use paulStartTime for local | ✅ Resolved |
